## 💫 About Me

🌌 **What I'm currently working on:**
I'm an aspiring Machine Learning Engineer and Data Analyst, developing AI-driven accessibility solutions like real-time Indian Sign Language (ISL) translation tools and Conversational Image Recognition Chatbots. I also work on data analytics, computer vision, and NLP-based AI models, applying my skills in TensorFlow, Keras, and Power BI to solve real-world problems.

👥 **What I'm looking to collaborate on:**
I'm open to collaborations in machine learning, AI for accessibility, NLP, computer vision, and data visualization. If you're building assistive technology, AI-powered chatbots, or real-time ISL interpreters, I'd love to contribute!

🤝 **What I'm looking for help with:**
- Optimizing deep learning models for real-time translation
- Improving 3D avatar animations for ISL gestures
- Enhancing AI-powered accessibility tools
- Advanced data visualization techniques in Power BI

🌱 **What I'm currently learning:**
I'm diving deeper into Generative AI, transfer learning, and real-time NLP models, along with advanced data visualization techniques to improve AI-driven decision-making.

💬 **Topics people can ask me about:**
- Machine Learning & Deep Learning (CNNs, NLP, TensorFlow, Keras)
- AI for Accessibility (Indian Sign Language translation, speech-to-text models)
- Data Science & Analytics (Power BI, Python, R, visualization)
- Real-Time AI Applications

⚡ **A fun fact about me:**
Beyond AI and coding, I’m active in my college's Arts & Dramatics club and enjoy playing cricket. I love blending creativity with technology to build impactful solutions!
